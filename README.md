Map

To view this project, open map.html in a web browser.

I created a map that highlights 4 parks and 1 garden in Richmond, VA.

You can search for 'garden' or 'park' in the search box and a corresponding list will populate, along with markers on the map showing the locations of those parks or garden. 

In the list, you can click the name of the park or garden and a marker will appear with more information of the location. You can also scroll up and down to see additional items in the list.

An Info box will appear when a marker is clicked. Each info box will populate information about the location, including the address, a link to foursquare for more information, and a brief summary or review a user left on foursquare. 

The foursquare icon also appears on the infowindow.

The map has additional functions. In the top right corner you can choose map with or withoug terrain view, satellite view with or without labels.
